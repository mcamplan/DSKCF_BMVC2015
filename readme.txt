This MATLAB code implements the DS-KCF tracker.

It is free for research use. If you find it useful, please acknowledge the paper
above with a reference. 


__________
Quickstart

1. Extract code somewhere. 

2. The tracker is ready to run on any of the 5 video sequences contained in
the data folder. 

DATA FOLDER CAN BE DOWNLOADED FROM
http://dx.doi.org/10.5523/bris.16vbnj3im1ygi1sh0yd0mt4lp0

3. Execute runDSKCF.m located in the testDS-KCFScripts folder 

4. Results will be generated in the DS-KCFresults folder


Documentation is located in the ds-kcfDoc folder. Other information and 
references to other toolboxes used can be found in Contents.m

Note: The tracker uses the 'fhog'/'gradientMex' functions from Piotr's Toolbox.
Some pre-compiled MEX files are provided for convenience. If they do not work for your
system, just get the toolbox from http://vision.ucsd.edu/~pdollar/toolbox/doc/index.html

Note: we tested this code in both windows and linux machine. Problems have 
been found with Matlab version 2015 while saving image results. Deactivate
image saving options if you are using that version (see runDSKCF.m)
